Thanks for your feedback. Agreed, SVGs are faster than other formats. However, I wouldn't say SVGs are worst for SEO as they use a Title Tags which allow crawlers to know what they are about.

To keep things simple:
- Use SVGs whenever possible (logos, icons)
- Use JPGs as your default image format
- Use PNGs when you NEED transparency or if there is text within the image
- Use GIFs if you want an animated image that will play on all devices (be aware this format can slow down your pages dramatically)
